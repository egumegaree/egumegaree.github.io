							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
								I've used easing before in other animation programs but never learned why and in what situations they should be 
								used, so this article was incredibly informative in detailing how these curves should be used and which scenarios 
								they should be used in. For example, I learned a lot about how you should consider how an object's movement on the 
								screen (emerging, disappearing, moving from one side of the screen to another) can be enhanced by the type of easing 
								curve (emerging objects should use a deceleration curve to draw attention, for example). This guide is obviously 
								geared towards UX design, but I think it can be useful for thinking about animation in general, such as how you can 
								incorporate real world physics into animations and how different uses for animation (for web design, apps, videos, 
								story animations, etc.) may require different ways of animating objects/applications of the principles of animation.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
								I liked all of the gifs depicting the animation uses and curves! It really helps visualize how and why certain 
								animation speeds, durations, or curves work, and I especially likes how the gifs in the section on choreography 
								does a slowed replay to show the directions/curves that objects should or should not move on screen. In addition, 
								I found the research statistics at the beginning of the article really interesting. For example, it's surprising 
								that the animation durations for different devices should be different due to the size of the screen.

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>
								“For the animation not to look mechanical and artificial, the object should move with some acceleration or 
								deceleration — just like all live objects in the physical world.”
