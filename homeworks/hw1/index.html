                From this article, I learned how I can study design when browsing a website or app by focusing on the reasons behind various
                design elements that catch my eye (or don't) and why those elements were able to stand out. In addition, I learned that specific of wording 
                or information is important to consider when thinking about how a user would want to interact with the app or what we want a user 
                interpret/learn from the app. 
            </li>
            <li>I really like how the article broke down the design of several examples! For example, the analysis on the specific wording in the 
                tweet interface was really helpful in thinking about what information needs to be conveyed in specific views and how a user would 
                interpret the wording. It gives great guidance on how we can go about analyzing other interface designs.

            <li>"If you could see the harsh drop shadows and unnecessary flourish I added to things, you would gasp in horror."
                (I used to add drop shadow to everything too... Kind of shows how we all start and how we can improve how we think about design!)
            </li>
            <li>8; I thought the article was really informative in a concise manner!</li>
