						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned how to start thinking about accessibility
								in websites. The various examples showcase common instances of color 
								inaccessible features and how one can incorporate contrast, messaging, 
								iconography, patterns, and textures to make elements have greater visual 
								contrast and so that elements do not rely on just to color to convey meaning.
								The article also provides additional resources (such as Colorable) that 
								will be really helpful in checking the contrast rating of colors. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really like the visual examples of what you shouldn't do and how you can
								make certain features more accessible. For example, the example of how to 
								indicate an error in a form field was quite eye-opening as to why many 
								websites I've seen incorporate symbols aside from just the color red to 
								indicate an error. I also thought the example from Trello with textured/
								patterned label colors was really interesting. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "In 2017, The World Health Organization estimated that roughly 217 million people live with some form of moderate to severe vision impairment."</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 9; the article is quite insightful on how you should start thinking about
								color-accessibility and incorporating accessibility features into a website, but
								the section on focus state contrast was a bit unclear.</p>
