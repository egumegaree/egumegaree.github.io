							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p>I think the topic of attention and UX is really interesting because I think that how well a design can draw attention to what you want is a significant part of what differentiates an effective design and an ineffective design. The explanations of human information processing in relation to design and the types of attention were interesting and made me realize the limitations of human attention can be important to consider in UX design. I think that the article linked under the cocktail party effect section was a great example of how to consider human psychology in visual elements. In addition, the explanations of each type of attention and examples of how a UX designer might incorporate these types of attention into their designs was interesting as well. </p>
