							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
								I learned about various resources I can use when choosing font style, size, and color. A section I found especially useful was the section on pairing inspiration since I've never thought too much on how to pair fonts. I also learned about typography style guides, which seem like a great way to detail a preview of the design and stay consistent in typography style.

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
								My favorite part of the article was the discussion of font size! I've never considered using ratios as a starting point for determining a sequence of aesthetically pleasing font sizes since I've mostly done all font size choices by eye and intuition. I thought it was really interesting that the author presented several naturally occurring ratios while also explaining why certain ratios might not work (like the golden ratio).

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>
								"Also, be mindful of the purpose of a font. For example, some fonts are more suited to be headers rather than body text. For this reason, before choosing a font, research its intended purpose."
								I never knew fonts had any intended usage in terms of whether they are better for certain parts of a text, so this is just something to keep in mind.
