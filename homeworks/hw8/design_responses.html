						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>I learned a lot about various dark patterns that are used, how to recognize them, and how to approach designing without dark patterns. It's interesting seeing how many tactics are purposefully misleading or confusing to take advantage of users, and I learned that the fact that users usually skim/scan instead of read is often taken advantage of by these tactics (and even before the web employed dark patterns). What I also learned and found most interesting was that the use of dark patterns was prosecuted against in the LinkedIn class-action lawsuit, though it's also surprising that the dark patterns used in this case still seem so prevalent.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>I like the examples from real websites because it helps me identify what these dark patterns might look like in real website or software UX design. For example, I really liked the Skype update installer example of misdirection since I could not have pictured what a use of misdirection might look like just from the definition, but it's actually something I've encountered a lot and has even led me to install malware, which is why the dark pattern has actually made me develop the habit of carefully reading the steps in installers. I also liked the Dafont example since I've seen people fall for disguised ads similar to the ones on the Dafont website, which is now why I look out for big, green download buttons (which are usual ads).</p>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p>“The most famous example of this dark pattern was used by LinkedIn, which resulted in them being fined $13 million dollars as part of a class action lawsuit in 2015.”</p>
