                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>The article presents various examples of UI interactions with animations, and I learned from these examples how I can think about making UI interactive and have a sense of action. For example, the “Midnight Hour” example showed how you might be able to add a sense of engagement to a page that usually doesn't involve much interaction (company about page). The animation for the “Create a new message example” also shows how you could use color with animations to highlight changes and selections in the UI.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>My favorite part of the article is just seeing all the animations! I enjoyed looking at all the uses of layout and color to enhance engagement with each of the website UIs. I also liked being surprised by how the creators decided to use animations to add dynamicity to the UI. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>Out of all of the examples, I especially liked the “Add to Cart” animation (the one with the Nike shoe). Though I think initially accessing the “add to cart” menu is a bit unintuitive, the transition into the men u is really dynamic and eye-catching, which adds to the engagement of the UI. The changes in item image when you change the size or color in the UI is my favorite part of this example, and I think it would personally help me know clearly what I added to the cart. I also really liked the easygrow.io app preview since I liked how the important information is displayed clearly and even though there's quite of bit of information provided, it's organized such that it's easily digestible. (Also, I just like how the background colors go well with each plant!) </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p>8; Great for inspiration, but I wish there were at least some references for how to approach implementing these kinds of UI animations.</p>
