						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about certain Gestalt principles to keep in mind when thinking about UI design and how grouping elements in certain ways can produce cohesive or eye-catching effects. For example, I learned about how the similarity principle causes grouping of elements that are similar to each other and that some qualities that are similar can be more effective in grouping than others (i.e. colour>size>shape). I also learned about how proximity of elements aids in organizing various elements of the UI into cohesive groups. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really liked the example layouts for each principle (though I wish there was an explanation for exactly what elements in the layout the principle is being applied for). My favorite example is the example for the closure principle because it clearly shows how closure can be incorporated into iconography. In addition, the example for the symmetry principle was clear as well due to the use of contrastive colors for symmetry. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “There are different ways of making elements perceived as being similar, and thus, related. These include similarity of colour, size, shape, texture, dimension, and orientation; with some of them being more strongly communicative than others (ex. colour > size > shape).” </p>
						</li>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 7; the article was informative in illstrating various principles, but I think the example designs should have a more detailed explanation of how the principles were applied. </p>
